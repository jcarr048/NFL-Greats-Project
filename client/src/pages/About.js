        This website has compiled the best players for each team. In addition,
        we wanted to give the user the chance to have their voice heard if they
        did not agree with the selected player. If you disagree with the
        subjectively selected player, you can simply delete the player and
        create a new player from that franchise. Also, we allow our users to
        keep the player's stats up to date by allowing them to update a player
        if needed.
